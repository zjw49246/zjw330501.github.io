        <p>
            In the fields of streaming algorithms and cryptography, hash 
            functions are very important. Good hash functions should have
            both efficiency and small collision probability. Completely 
            random hash functions have small collision probability 1/<i>M</i> where 
            <i>M</i> is the size of the output space of the hash function. However,
            representing completely random hash functions costs big space, and
            calculating hash values is also very time-consuming. Therefore,
            we would like to propose new hash functions based on the completely
            random hash functions. And we are going to show such functions in 
            the following.

        </p>
        <p>
            After we obtained good hash functions. We can apply them in the 
            count-min sketch algorithm, which is one of streaming algorithms 
            designed to process stream data with small space and time. We can
            use hash functions to map the original data into a much smaller
            space where processing the mapped data costs much less space and 
            time. However, since hash functions cause collisions in the mapping,
            the results in the mapped space is an estimate of those in the
            original space. Therefore, we need to pick suitable hash function
            sets to maintain both efficiency and accuracy of estimates.

        <h2>Universal Hashing</h2>
        <p>
            The definition of universal hash families is as follows:
            <br><b>Definition.</b> A family <i>H</i> of hash functions mapping
            <i>U</i> to <i>M</i> is universal if, for every two different keys
            <i>x</i> &ne; <i>y</i> &in; <i>U</i>, we have 
            Pr<sub>h &larr; H</sub>[<i>h(x)</i> = <i>h(y)</i>] &leq; 1/<i>M</i>
        </p>
        <p>
            We constrcut an efficient universal hashing family as follows:
            <br>1. Suppose <i>U</i> = 2<sup><i>u</i></sup> and 
            <i>M</i> = 2<sup><i>m</i></sup>.
            <br>2. Randomly initialize a matrix <i>A</i> = 
            {0, 1}<sup><i>m</i>&times;<i>u</i></sup>.
            <br>3. For an input vector <i>x</i> &in; {0, 1}<sup><i>u</i></sup>
            (we can regard it as the binary representation of a number), 
            <i>h<sub>A</sub></i>(<i>x</i>) = <i>Ax</i>, and the calculation is done
            modulo 2.
            <br>4. The efficient universal hashing family is <i>H</i> = 
            {<i>h<sub>A</sub></i>: <i>U</i> &rarr; <i>M</i> | 
            <i>A</i> &in; {0, 1}<sup><i>m</i>&times;<i>u</i></sup>}.
        </p>
        <br>

        <h3>Visualization tool for universal hash functions</h3>
        <p class="tool">
            To use this tool, you need to enter input dim <i>u</i>, output 
            dim <i>m</i> and number of inputs <i>N</i>. Then, 
            after clicking the "Submit" button, this tool will 
            randomizes <i>N</i> distinct <i>u</i>-bit {0, 1} vectors (has been converted
            to decimal numbers in the result) and <i>m</i>&times;<i>u</i> {0, 1}
            matrix. Next, hashing values will be calculated and the distribution 
            of the input and output will be displayed. In addition, the collision rate
            and the upper bound of collision probability 1/<i>M</i> will be calculated and displayed.
        </p>
        <p class="tool">
            From this visualization, we can see that the collision rate is close
            to <i>M</i>, and is no more than <i>M</i> in average, which confirms
            the small collision rate of this hash family. And as the difference
            between input dim and output dim becomes larger, the number of collisions
            increases. In addition, the increase of the number of inputs also increases
            collisions.
        </p>
        <p class="tool"><b>Examples:</b>
            <br>1. You can set input dim as 10, output dim as 8 and number of inputs
            as 100, and click the "Submit" button. You can see that a random 8 &times; 10
            matrix has been generated, In the top graph, we can see the distribution 
            of input values, 100 <b>distinct</b> numbers between 0 and 1023. In the bottom graph,
            we can see the distribution of output values, 100 numbers between 0 and 255.
            Some of them have frequency more than 1, which means that there are collisions
            after hashing. The collision rate and 1/<i>M</i> are also displayed. Try to 
            click the "Submit" button multiple times, you can see that collision rate is
            smaller than 1/<i>M</i> at most time and no more than 1/<i>M</i> in average.
            <br>2. Try to decrease output dim to 5, you can see that frequencies in the 
            bottom graph increases which means that number of collisions increases. In
            addition, collision rate also tends to increase. Try more values of these
            arguments and see how the results look like.

        <h2>Count-Min Sketch</h2>
        <p>
            When we need to process a large amount of stream data with limited
            space and time, we can use count-min sketch algorithm which is based
            on universal hash functions. For a vector <i>a</i> = 
            (<i>a<sub>1</sub></i>, ..., <i>a<sub><i>U</i></sub></i>) &in;
            Z<sup><i>U</i></sup>, we can do frequency query with count-min sketch. 
            For each element <i>e</i> in <i>a</i>, <i>a<sub><i>e</i></sub></i>
            is the frequency of <i>e</i> and &atilde;<sub><i>e</i></sub> is the 
            estimate of <i>a<sub><i>e</i></sub></i>.
            <br>1. Independently sample <i>h<sub>1</sub></i>, ..., 
            <i>h<sub><i>l</i></sub></i> hash functions from the universal family 
            <i>H</i>.
            <br>2. Initialize arrays <i>A<sub>1</sub></i>, ..., 
            <i>A<sub><i>l</i></sub></i> with all zeros.
            <br>3. When we deal with <i>e</i>, we add 
            <i>A</i><sub><i>k</i></sub>[<i>h</i><sub><i>k</i></sub>(<i>e</i>)] by 1
            for all <i>k</i> &in; {1, ..., <i>l</i>}.
            <br>4. When query the frequency of <i>e</i>, return 
            &atilde;<sub><i>e</i></sub> = min<sub>k &in; {1, ..., <i>l</i>}</sub>
            <i>A</i><sub><i>k</i></sub>[<i>h</i><sub><i>k</i></sub>(<i>e</i>)].

        <h3>Visualization tool for count-min sketch</h3>
        <p class="tool">
            To use this tool, you need to enter the number of inputs <i>N</i>,
            output dim <i>m</i> and number of hash functions <i>l</i>. Then,  
            after clicking the "Submit" button,
            the tool will randomly generate a vector with <i>N</i> integers and
            <i>l</i> universal hash functions with output dim <i>m</i>. Next,
            the tool will execute count-min sketch algorithm and calculate
            frequency of each element step by step. The true frequency of the 
            input and estimate frequency will be displayed in red and blue
            respectively.
        </p>
        <p class="tool">
            At every step, there is a new input number. Then, the true frequency 
            of this input increases by 1 (one new red line on the top graph), and 
            after executing count-min algorithm, the estimate of frequency will be 
            displayed in blue lines in the bottom graph. In the mean time, all red 
            lines in the top graph are also displayed in the bottom graph and covers
            blue lines. If all the blue lines are covered by red lines, then our 
            estimate is perfectly accurate. Otherwise, more uncovered blue lines,
            less accurate the estimate is.
        </p>
        <p class="tool">
            We can see that more hash functions there are, more accurate the
            frequency estimate is. In addition, higher output dim also decrease
            the error of estimate.
        </p>
        <p class="tool"><b>Examples:</b>
            <br>1. You can set number of inputs as 100, output dim as 4 and number
            of hash functions as 1, and click "Submit" button. You will see that at
            each step, there is a new input, and the frequency of that input increases
            by 1 (one new red line of length 1 appears in both the top and the bottom graph). 
            Then, the tool executes count-min sketch algorithm and calculates the 
            estimate frequency of all the inputs (displayed as blue lines in the bottom 
            graph). We can see that some
            blue lines are covered by red lines but the others are not, which means the
            estimate frequencies are biased and the uncovered blue lines represents the bias part.
            <br>2. Click the "Reset" button to clear the display. Try to increase output 
            dim to 6 and number of hash functions to 10, and click the "Submit" button.
            You will see that the number of uncovered blue lines decreases, which means 
            that the estimate frequencies become more accurate. Try more values of these
            arguments and see how the results look like.
